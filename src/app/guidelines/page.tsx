          Peer reviewers play a role in ensuring the integrity of the scholarly
          record. The peer review process depends to a large extent on the trust
          and willing participation of the scholarly community and requires that
          everyone involved behaves responsibly and ethically.
        </p>

        <p>
          Peer reviewers play a central and critical part in the peer review
          process, but may come to the role without any guidance and be unaware
          of their ethical obligations. Journals have an obligation to provide
          transparent policies for peer review, and reviewers have an obligation
          to conduct reviews in an ethical and accountable manner. Clear
          communication between the journal and the reviewers is essential to
          facilitate a consistent, fair and timely review.
        </p>

        <p>
          Peer review, for the purposes of these guidelines, refers to reviews
          provided on manuscript submissions to journals, but can also include
          reviews for other platforms and apply to public commenting that can
          occur pre- or post-publication. Reviews of other materials such as
          preprints, grants, books, conference proceeding submissions,
          registered reports (pre-registered protocols), or data will have a
          similar underlying ethical framework, but the process will vary
          depending on the source material and the type of review requested. The
          model of peer review will also influence elements of the process.
        </p>

          Being a reviewer
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Professional responsibility
        </h3>
        <p>
          Authors who have benefited from the peer review process should
          consider becoming peer reviewers as a part of their professional
          responsibilities. Some journals require a formal process of
          appointment to the review panel, and some require specific expertise;
          anyone interested in becoming a reviewer should look for the journal
          guidelines on peer review and follow any requirements posted. In order
          to assign appropriate reviewers, editors must match reviewers with the
          scope of the content in a manuscript to get the best reviews possible.
          Potential reviewers should provide journals with personal and
          professional information that is accurate and a fair representation of
          their expertise, including verifiable and accurate contact
          information. It is important to recognize that impersonation of
          another individual during the review process is considered serious
          misconduct (e.g. see COPE Case 12-12: Compromised peer review in
          published papers). When approached to review, agree to review only if
          you have the necessary expertise to assess the manuscript and can be
          unbiased in your assessment. It is better to identify clearly any gaps
          in your expertise when asked to review.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Competing interests</h3>
        <p>
          Ensure you declare all potential competing, or conflicting, interests.
          If you are unsure about a potential competing interest that may
          prevent you from reviewing, do raise this. Competing interests may be
          personal, financial, intellectual, professional, political or
          religious in nature. If you are currently employed at the same
          institution as any of the authors or have been recent (e.g., within
          the past 3 years) mentors, mentees, close collaborators or joint grant
          holders, you should not agree to review. In addition, you should not
          agree to review a manuscript just to gain sight of it with no
          intention of submitting a review, or agree to review a manuscript that
          is very similar to the one you have in preparation or under
          consideration at another journal.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Timeliness</h3>
        <p>
          It is courteous to respond to an invitation to peer review within a
          reasonable time-frame, even if you cannot undertake the review. If you
          feel qualified to judge a particular manuscript, you should agree to
          review only if you are able to return a review within the proposed or
          mutually agreed on time-frame. Always inform the journal promptly if
          your circumstances change and you cannot fulfill your original
          agreement or if you require an extension. If you cannot review, it is
          helpful to make suggestions for alternative reviewers if relevant,
          based on their expertise and without any influence of personal
          considerations or any intention of the manuscript receiving a specific
          outcome (either positive or negative).
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
          Conducting a review
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Initial steps</h3>
        <p>
          Read the manuscript, supplementary data files and ancillary material
          thoroughly (e.g., reviewer instructions, required ethics and policy
          statements), getting back to the journal if anything is not clear and
          requesting any missing or incomplete items you need. Do not contact
          the authors directly without the permission of the journal. It is
          important to understand the scope of the review before commencing
          (i.e., is a review of raw data expected?).
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Confidentiality</h3>
        <p>
          Respect the confidentiality of the peer review process and refrain
          from using information obtained during the peer review process for
          your own or another's an advantage, or to disadvantage or discredit
          others (e.g. see COPE Case 14-06: Possible breach of reviewer
          confidentiality). Do not involve anyone else in the review of a
          manuscript (including early career researchers you are mentoring),
          without first obtaining permission from the journal (e.g. see COPE
          Case 11-29: Reviewer asks the trainee to review manuscript). The names
          of any individuals who have helped with the review should be included
          so that they are associated with the manuscript in the journal's
          records and can also receive due recognition for their efforts.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Bias and competing interests
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is important to remain unbiased by considerations related to the
          nationality, religious or political beliefs, gender or other
          characteristics of the authors, origins of a manuscript or by
          commercial considerations. If you discover a competing interest that
          might prevent you from providing a fair and unbiased review, notify
          the journal and seek advice (e.g. see COPE Case 15-05: Reviewer
          requests to be added as an author after publication). While waiting
          for a response, refrain from looking at the manuscript and associated
          material in case the request to review is rescinded. Similarly, notify
          the journal as soon as possible if you find you do not have the
          necessary expertise to assess the relevant aspects of a manuscript so
          as not to unduly delay the review process. In the case of double-blind
          review, if you suspect the identity of the author(s) notify the
          journal if this knowledge raises any potential competing or conflict
          of interest.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Suspicion of ethics violations
        </h3>
        <p>
          If you come across any irregularities with respect to research and
          publication ethics do let the journal know (e.g. see COPE Case 02-11:
          Contacting research ethics committees with concerns over studies). For
          example, you may have concerns that misconduct occurred during either
          the research or the writing and submission of the manuscript, or you
          may notice the substantial similarity between the manuscript and a
          concurrent submission to another journal or a published article. In
          the case of these or any other ethical concerns, contact the editor
          directly and do not attempt to investigate on your own. It is
          appropriate to cooperate, in confidence, with the journal, but not to
          personally investigate further unless the journal asks for additional
          information or advice.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Transferability of peer review
        </h3>
        <p>
          Publishers may have policies related to transferring peer reviews to
          other journals in the publisher's portfolio (sometimes referred to as
          portable or cascading peer review). Reviewers may be asked to give
          permission for the transfer of their reviews if that is journal
          policy. If a manuscript is rejected from one journal and submitted to
          another, and you are asked to review that same manuscript, you should
          be prepared to review the manuscript afresh as it may have changed
          between the two submissions and the journal's criteria for evaluation
          and acceptance may be different. In the interests of transparency and
          efficiency, it may be appropriate to provide your original review for
          the new journal (with permission to do so from the original journal),
          explaining that you had reviewed the submission previously and noting
          any changes.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
          Preparing a report
        </h2>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Format</h3>
        <p>
          Follow journals' instructions for writing and posting the review. If a
          particular format or scoring rubric is required, use the tools
          supplied by the journal. Be objective and constructive in your review,
          providing feedback that will help the authors to improve their
          manuscript. For example, be specific in your critique, and provide
          supporting evidence with appropriate references to substantiate
          general statements, to help editors in their evaluation. Be
          professional and refrain from being hostile or inflammatory and from
          making libelous or derogatory personal comments or unfounded
          accusations.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Appropriate feedback
        </h3>
        <p>
          Bear in mind that the editor requires a fair, honest, and unbiased
          assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the manuscript. Most
          journals allow reviewers to provide confidential comments to the
          editor as well as comments to be read by the authors. The journal may
          also ask for a recommendation to accept/revise/reject; any
          recommendation should be congruent with the comments provided in the
          review. If you have not reviewed the whole manuscript, do indicate
          which aspects of the manuscript you have assessed. Ensure your
          comments and recommendations for the editor are consistent with your
          report for the authors; most feedback should be put in the report that
          the authors will see. Confidential comments to the editor should not
          be a place for denigration or false accusation, done in the knowledge
          that the authors will not see your comments.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Language and style</h3>
        <p>
          Remember it is the authors' paper, so do not attempt to rewrite it to
          your own preferred style if it is basically sound and clear;
          suggestions for changes that improve clarity are, however, important.
          In addition, be aware of the sensitivities surrounding language issues
          that are due to the authors writing in a language that is not their
          first or most proficient language, and phrase the feedback
          appropriately and with due respect.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Suggestions for further work
        </h3>
        <p>
          It is the job of the peer reviewer to comment on the quality and rigor
          of the work they receive. If the work is not clear because of missing
          analyses, the reviewer should comment and explain what additional
          analyses would clarify the work submitted. It is not the job of the
          reviewer to extend the work beyond its current scope. Be clear which
          (if any) suggested additional investigations are essential to support
          claims made in the manuscript under consideration and which will just
          strengthen or extend the work.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Accountability</h3>
        <p>
          Prepare the report by yourself, unless you have permission from the
          journal to involve another person. Refrain from making unfair negative
          comments or including unjustified criticisms of any competitors' work
          that is mentioned in the manuscript. Refrain from suggesting that
          authors include citations to your (or an associate's) work merely to
          increase citation counts or to enhance the visibility of your or your
          associate's work; suggestions must be based on valid academic or
          technological reasons. Do not intentionally prolong the review
          process, either by delaying the submission of your review or by
          requesting unnecessary additional information from the journal or
          author. If you are the editor handling a manuscript and decide to
          provide a review of that manuscript yourself (perhaps if another
          reviewer could not return a report), do this transparently and not
          under the guise of an anonymous additional reviewer.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">
          What to consider after peer review
        </h2>
        <p>
          If possible, try to accommodate requests from journals to review
          revisions or resubmissions of manuscripts you have reviewed
          previously. It is helpful to respond promptly if contacted by a
          journal about matters related to your review and to provide the
          information required. Similarly, contact the journal if anything
          relevant comes to light after you have submitted your review that
          might affect your original feedback and recommendations. Continue to
          respect the confidential nature of the review process and do not
          reveal details of the manuscript after peer review unless you have
          permission from the author and the journal.
